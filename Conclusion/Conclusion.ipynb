It changes when the bougosie gets ahold of 1) the state which takes over a state or creates a state which can legally do things to support capitalism.  2)The credit system.  This is connected with the state through the public debt.  To start businesses, you need large amount of capital.  YOu also need centralization of capital.  Centralization is about large companies taking over small companies and further waves of privatization.  This is also **accumulation by disposetion**.  You can do this with the help of the credit system and the state."
