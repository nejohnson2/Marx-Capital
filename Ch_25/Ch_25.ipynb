There is a theorectical arguemnt which is a critque of classical political economy which said let the free market do its work and everything will be ok.  Marx says assume that utopian idea and see what will happen.  First you'll have monopolys which shouldnt happen.  Secondly, will it work for the benefit of the worker?  That's what the classical political people say.  Marx says no.  The rich get richer and the poorer have gotten poorer.  Marx proves this throughout the book.  These come out in Ch 25.  \n",
